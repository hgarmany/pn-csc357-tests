# pn-csc357-tests
This Repo is an open source collection of test cases for Dr. Phillip Nico's CSC-357 class.

## Use
Go to the appropriate directory to use/add test cases for any given lab or assignment.
Refer to README's in each directory for specific instructions for adding/editing/testing.

## Contributions
- To add your test cases, start by forking/branching this repo (see naming conventions). 
- In this branch, you can add and edit your test cases freely. 
- When you are ready to share them, push your changes and create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch. 
- Pull requests will be reviewed and accepted by designated contributors

- Add a message to the Piazza forum if you would like to help review pull requests

## Naming conventions
Label your branch with the first 2 characters of your first and last name. Optionally, make a new branch for each lab or assignment and label as such.
- Ex: Phillip Nico, Assignment 1 -> phni-asgn01

Label all your test files with the first 2 characters of your first and last name
- Ex: Phillip Nico -> phni-test01
- This is to avoid overwriting other people's test files

## Honor Rule
For now, the hope is to leave the permissions to this repo open for anyone to edit and upload their tests.
This means that we need to keep the file structure organized and our code clean.
It also means don't upload random programs or, god forbid, viruses.
